To provide credentials to your app, place an empty credentials.json file into this directory. This file will be ignored by git and SHOULD NOT be added to your repo.
During build, CredentialsVendor.exe will create an STS client to retrieve temporary (1 hour) credentials, which will then be saved in credentials.json.
The created STS client will use stored credentials, as outlined here: http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/net/post/Tx1310VG2O81PSY/
